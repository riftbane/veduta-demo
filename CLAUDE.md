# Game project on Veduta

You are building a game with the Veduta engine. There is no display: verify everything
with the `veduta` MCP tools (or the CLI). Never try to open a window.

Loop: edit → `build` → `cook` → `simulate` / `render` / `inspect` → read the report →
fix → `diff` to confirm only the intended change → `test` → commit.

Rules
- Read reports before images. Open an image only to confirm a suspected issue.
- Assets are JSON sources under assets/. Never edit files under assets/.cooked.
- Every feature gets a scenario in tests/scenarios. Every bug fix gets a regression scenario.
- Keep the game deterministic: randomness only via ctx.RNG; no time.Now in game code.
- Run `fuzz` before every release; add minimized repros as scenarios.
- Commit small, message in imperative mood. Tag releases with `release` only when `test` is green.
- Do not add third-party Go modules.
- When something in the engine blocks you, write it down in ENGINE-NOTES.md with a repro,
  do not work around it silently.
